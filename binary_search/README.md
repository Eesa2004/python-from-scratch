# Binary Search Algorithms

This folder contains Python implementations of binary search algorithms and data structures.

## Files

- **binary_search.py**  
  Implements the classic binary search algorithm to find the position of a value in a sorted list.

- **binary_search_tree.py**  
  Implements a binary search tree (BST) data structure with methods for adding values, checking membership, and traversing the tree.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Algorithm implementation (binary search)
- Data structures (binary search tree)
- Recursion and tree traversal
- Python class design

## Usage

You can run each script directly to see example usage or import the classes/functions into your own projects.
